# HabitsTrack v1.0
  - A Habitica-themed command-line program that allows you to log activities and habits in exchange for 'gold'.
  - You can create custom spends along with their prices, and as you complete more tasks, your gold multipliers also increase.


## Usage
  - Clone the repository in whichever location you want to keep it
      `git clone https://github.com/patelpratham11/habitsTrack.git`
  - Initialize the *data.txt* file to be the following values
      `0,0,0,0,0,0,`
  - Initialize the spends file following the given format or you can leave it blank
  - Run the file and follow the prompts from your command line
      `python3 points.py`

## Potential Updates
  - Inclusion of other gold-spend mechanics
  - Better gold-multiplier
  - Inclusion of streaks
